# Maximize-Earnings-for-Airbnb-hosts
Project Title: Maximizing Earnings for NYC Airbnb Hosts 

Objective: Utilize supervised learning to predict Airbnb rental prices in New York City and uncover key factors that influence pricing strategies for hosts. 

Problem Statement: Airbnb hosts need to competitively price their listings to maximize earnings while ensuring high occupancy rates. The challenge is to develop a predictive model that determines the optimal listing price based on the property's characteristics and location within New York City. 

Data: Use the "New York City Airbnb Open Data" dataset from Kaggle, which includes details about listings such as location, room type, and price.

Visualization Requirements: 

Geographic scatter plot of Airbnb listings color-coded by price to visualize spatial distribution. 

Box plot of prices by room type to show the variation in price across different types of accommodations. 

Code: Employ R for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training. Use libraries such as ggplot2 for visualization or dplyr for data manipulation 



Incorporating Supervised Learning: 

Perform an exploratory data analysis to understand the factors affecting Airbnb prices. 

Preprocess data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or scaling features as necessary. 

Use a supervised learning algorithm 

Instructions: 

Perform data cleaning to handle any missing or inconsistent data entries. 

Create visualizations to understand the distribution of prices and the relationship between price and other features. 

Train a supervised learning model to predict the price using features like location coordinates, room type, and any other relevant variables in the dataset. 

Validate the model's predictive performance using a test dataset or cross-validation.
